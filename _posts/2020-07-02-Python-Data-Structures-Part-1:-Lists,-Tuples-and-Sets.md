One of the most important parts when learning a new language is understanding the built-in data structures available for us in the language. We will start this series reviewing the most basic linear data structures: Sets, Lists (similar to Arrays) and Tuples. We will review the basic constructs, when its use is appropiate and general recommendations when using each data structure. We will use Python 3 for all examples.

## Lists

Lists are collections of objects. They work as dynamic sized arrays. Pyhton lists have some characteristics that makes them different than other languages arrays:

 - Lists are not homogeneus: this means that a list can contain elements from different Data Types, like Strings, int, or Objects (or other data structures).
 - Lists are Mutable: Mutable is a fancy word to describe a simple things: Lists can be changed at runtime. If I have a list with n elements, I can add or remove elements from that list after list creation.
