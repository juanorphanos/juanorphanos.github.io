One of the most important parts when learning a new language is understanding the built-in data structures available for us in the language. We will start this series reviewing the most basic linear data structures: Sets, Lists (similar to Arrays) and Tuples. We will review the basic constructs, when its use is appropiate and general recommendations when using each data structure. We will use Python 3 for all examples.

## Lists

Lists are collections of objects. They work as dynamic sized arrays. Python lists have some characteristics that makes them different than other languages arrays:

 - Lists are not Homogeneus: this means that a list can contain elements from different Data Types, like Strings, int, or Objects (or other data structures).
 
 - Lists are Mutable: Mutable is a fancy word to describe a simple things: Lists can be changed at runtime. If I have a list with n elements, I can add or remove elements from that list after list creation.
 
 - Lists are Ordered: this means that elements have an order within the data structure, we can say "the first element of the list", "the last element", "the nth element". We can use an index to retrieve the "n"th element of the list ( my_list[i] returns the i th element)
